# UI notes


- Create a New Repository
  
  - Go to GitHub: Log in to your GitHub account.
  - New Repository: Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository".
  - Repository Details: Fill in the repository name (e.g., notes) and description (optional). Choose whether you want the repository to be public or private.
  - Initialize with README: Check the box to initialize the repository with a README file.
  - Create Repository: Click "Create repository".
- Organize Your Notes
  
  - You can organize your notes in the repository by creating folders and markdown files. Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax that is easy to read and write.

  - Create Folders and Files
  - Go to Your Repository: Navigate to the repository you just created.
  - Create a New File: Click on the "Add file" button and select "Create new file".
  - Folder Structure: To create a folder, type the folder name followed by a slash (e.g., topic1/notes.md). GitHub will recognize this as a new folder and file.
  - Add Content: Write your notes in the markdown file using markdown syntax.
  - Commit Changes: Scroll down and click "Commit new file" to save the file to the repository.
